# 🚀 Digital Twin for Aeronautical Sensor Manufacturing

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Digital Twin** dashboard for **aeronautical sensor manufacturing** using **Dash (Plotly)**. The system simulates and visualizes manufacturing data, providing insights into production efficiency, defect detection, and sensor calibration processes.

**🔗 Visualize the dashboard at:** [https://digitaltwins-production.up.railway.app/](https://digitaltwins-production.up.railway.app/) 🚀


### ✅ Features:
- **Monitor production steps** in real-time  
- **Analyze technician performance**  
- **Identify failure patterns** in sensor manufacturing  
- **Compare estimated vs. real processing times**  
- **Track production variations per month**  

The project is **hosted on Railway** for easy deployment and accessibility.
